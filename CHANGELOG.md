### BREAKING CHANGES

Due to the rebrand from LogWard to LogTide, the following changes require action when upgrading:

**Environment Variables (rename in your `.env` file):**
| Old Variable | New Variable |
|-------------|--------------|
| `LOGWARD_PORT` | `LOGTIDE_PORT` |
| `LOGWARD_BACKEND_IMAGE` | `LOGTIDE_BACKEND_IMAGE` |
| `LOGWARD_FRONTEND_IMAGE` | `LOGTIDE_FRONTEND_IMAGE` |

**Fluent Bit Configuration (if using custom config):**
- Internal variables in `fluent-bit.conf` renamed: `${LOGWARD_API_KEY}` → `${LOGTIDE_API_KEY}`, `${LOGWARD_API_HOST}` → `${LOGTIDE_API_HOST}`
- If you're using the default config from the repo, just pull the new version
- The `.env` variable `FLUENT_BIT_API_KEY` remains unchanged

**Database Defaults (only affects new installations):**
- Default database name: `logward` → `logtide`
- Default database user: `logward` → `logtide`
- Existing installations can keep the old names by setting `DB_NAME` and `DB_USER` explicitly

**Docker (update your docker-compose overrides if any):**
- Container names: `logward-*` → `logtide-*` (e.g., `logward-backend` → `logtide-backend`)
- Network name: `logward-network` → `logtide-network`
- Default images: `logward/backend` → `logtide/backend`, `logward/frontend` → `logtide/frontend`
- GHCR images: `ghcr.io/logward-dev/logward-*` → `ghcr.io/logtide-dev/logtide-*`

**Service Names:**
- Internal service names changed from `logward-backend`/`logward-worker` to `logtide-backend`/`logtide-worker`
- This affects logs if you filter by service name

**SMTP Default:**
- Default sender: `noreply@logward.local` → `noreply@logtide.local`
- Override with `SMTP_FROM` if you have a custom sender

**Migration Guide:**
1. Stop your containers: `docker compose down`
2. Update your `.env` file with renamed variables
3. Pull new images: `docker compose pull`
4. Start containers: `docker compose up -d`
5. Data is preserved - no database migration needed

- **Website Separation**: Homepage and documentation moved to dedicated website
  - Landing page and all documentation pages moved to [logtide.dev](https://logtide.dev)
  - App homepage now redirects to `/dashboard` (authenticated) or `/login` (unauthenticated)
  - All internal `/docs` links updated to external `https://logtide.dev/docs`
  - Navbar, Footer, and empty state components updated with external documentation links
